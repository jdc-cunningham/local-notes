I am excited at the thought of writing my own code again.

I've been mentally blocked for a while now. Right now I'm still tired/not sleeping well so I'm not as good as I can be.

You can see the design above. Pretty much you have a starting main text body area, then if you want more add tabs...

I'm still playing around with the interface.

This is a way to categorize my thoughts right now.

I would like image support, but that adds some complexity where you have to do:
- drag-drop
- base64 (larger storage)
- contentEditable (can break it)

Still with a contentEditable approach you can make something pretty cool
